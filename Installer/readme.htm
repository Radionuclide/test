<P class="header2">Bugfixes</P>
<UL>
	<LI>For extracting to files, report generation and the copy task, when selecting to have subfolders in de destination
	directory that are the same as in the source .dat directory, the DatCoordinator could accidentely delete subfolders
	from the parent directory of the destination directory instead of cleaning up subfolders of the destination directory.
	This could only happen if there where .dat files in the source .dat directory that weren't in subfolders.
	If the destination directory was a shared network map, it caused a crash instead of actual deletion of folders.
